well be working now on a basic working skeleton.

what is it?
'''
a walking skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end to end function,

it need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components.

Then the architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel.
'''

simply put:
1. have data in db
2. API project to fetch the data
3. angular project to query the API and display it

- we'll start simple and and complexity later.
learning goals:
1. using dotnet CLI (come with dotnet sdk)
2. API controllers/endpoints (understand structure)
3. Entity Framework
4. API project structure (whats in it, how app starts)
5. config and env variables 
6. source control (commiting code for backup and version control)

Getting the users with roles:
- the odd thing is that the user manager don't have this functionality.
- we'll have to get it ourselves by querying the database.
- th reason is that we want admin to be able to update the users roles.
- go to AdminController.cs

test the users-with-roles endpoint:
Section 16: 'Get Roles as admin' success!

up next: edit the roles of the users.

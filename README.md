let's review what we learned in this section:
1. implemented the register functionality.
2. creating components
3. forms => two way binding
4. angular services for sharing data => singletons in their provided scope
5. observables, async pipes for subscribing/unsubscribing to observables
6. structural directives => conditionally rendering elements 
7. parent child communication => Input/Output

don't worry if you don't fully undated what we covered, these are the building blocks of angular.
your understanding of these concepts will grow as you go along.

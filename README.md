Section 15 summary:

what we have learned during the implementation of the messaging functionality
1. more many to many relationships, what are do you think about how this M2M relationship has implemented?
  * for me messages makes more sense, it;s not just likes, there is content the joint table represents
2. looking at query params, putting them in the url and reading them from the url
3. using route resolvers as means to get data before the component constructs (so life's easier without conditionals)

up next: getting to know the ASP.NET Core Identity framework

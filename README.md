creating our own controller:
- lets see what we allready have in WeatherForecastController.cs => go to file.
- lets create a controller => right click on Controllers folder => c# => Class.
- create and go to UsersController.cs

* test our api, go to https://localhost:5001/api/users
* a better wat to test API is using postman
* pay attention that the id is in camelCase, even though its TitleCate in our Entity.
  - this is because JSON keys are in camelCase and Microsoft follows that convention

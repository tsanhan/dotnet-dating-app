we'll create a new controller for our messages:
* you can try start to implement it your self half way through
* [5 min later] create and go to Controllers/MessagesController.cs

* testing. section 15:
  * start with login, success!
  * next, 'Create Message From [login] to [another user]', success!
  * see the message in the db, success!
  * login as [another user] and and send a message to [login]all in db so we'll have something to work with, success!

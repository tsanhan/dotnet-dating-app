publish to github:
why use source control?
1. backup
2. version control: history
3. sharing our code (with others of yourself on another computer)

* install git from git-scm.com.
* set an account at github

go to solution folder with the terminal:
if you have git install: `git status`
if there is no git repo then `git init`
vscode listed lots of changed to stage and commit but we don't need all of those
inside  `dotnet new --list` output there is 'gitignore' to create a file for git to use to know what to ignore
run `dotnet new gitignore`... see how the number of changed dropped?
inside .gitignore we can spot '[Bb]in/': that is the bin folder in different variations.. among other things

lets exclude appsettings too. there is no secrets there now but we'll add API keys later, and we don;t want those to be public

so just add appsettings.json to the end of the list

click on the + button in the source control menu in vscode. this will state all the changed.
write some commit message and we can press âœ” or just click on the ... button and 'commit'

- create a repo in github
- follow the instruction on 'new repository'
- if the push returns an error, we can use vecode to 'push to' and vscode will ask us for a password
- after the push make sure the code is in github

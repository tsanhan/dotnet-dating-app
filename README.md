Section 16 summary:

this section was all about ASP.NET Core Identity.

we implemented identity and learned about:
1. Using .net Identity
2. Role Management
3. Policy Based Authorization
4. UserManager<T>
5. SignInManager<T>
6. RoleManager<T>

we removed out custom authentication

you probably thinking, hay what about the photo part of the admin manager?
well, that is part of a challenge, coming up later.

up next, we'll add some LIVE capabilities to our app, and that means SignalR.

// 3. Getting help


- you can go through the module without mistakes...
- this will be great!
- but in any case, if you get error/stuck:

-- solve yourself first: --
1. try to understand what you are doing (this could be enough)
2. read the error (this could be enough)
3. search the error on google/so and learn from other's experience - you'r not so special or first (this could be enough)
-- get personal help: --
4. ask classmates (this could be enough)
5. you can ask me for the code and see if it works on your computer, investigate from there

tips:
1. check the basics (typos, start server, wrong url... etc);
2. help others if they ask (in a way they will benefit from it)

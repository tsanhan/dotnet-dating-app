Editing roles in the client:
what we need to so with the modal is:

1. pass the list of roles to the modal, together with the data of what roles the user has right now.
2. be able to see if the user checked the checkbox next to the role
3. passing this data back to the component the modal originated from.
4. accept the data from the modal and update the roles in the database.


we'll start with the modal part, we'll do the source component (user-management) part later.

go to roles-modal.component.ts

up next: see what is needed to be done to the source component (user-management.component.ts).

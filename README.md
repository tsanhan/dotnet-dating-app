Cleaning up the member service:
* one thing before we implement age filtering in the client:
* I want to give the gender a default value rather then get the user via GetUserByUserNameAsync.

* so we update our account controller, but first we'll update UserDto.cs first, go there

up next: adding some buttons for the user to click on to filter the results

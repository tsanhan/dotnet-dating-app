Setting up client pagination.
1. in the members list, we should see the 'Pagination' header and get 10 members only.
2. ok so the first thing we'll do is create an interface for the pagination information.
    * create and go to models/pagination.ts

* up next: display the pagination information for the user to switch between pages.

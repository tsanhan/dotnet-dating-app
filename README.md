tips for vscode users only:
1. install 'C#' extension, after install click 'yes'. if u didn't: shift+ctrl+p => type >assets and pick 'Generate assets for Build and Debug' 
2. install 'C# extensions' extension by JosKreativ (for now, create class template by right clicking a folder)
3. install 'Material Icon Theme'
4. turn on auto save: file => Auto Save
5. file => preferences => settings => "exclude" => add pattern: **/obj, **/bin
    * obj and bin folders are recreated but we never interact with them
6. file => preferences => settings => "folder" => uncheck "compact folders"
7. just make sure 'code' is in PATH: shift+ctrl+p => type >path => select 'Shell Command: install ... PATH'
    * so `code .` will work in any folder on the computer.

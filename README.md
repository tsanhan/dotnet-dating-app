Updating the API register method:

the first thing is to update the Register the RegisterDto, go to RegisterDto.cs

test the functionality in postman, section 12: 
* start with the register of a user, no authentication here, and test to store the token: success!
* test if user can login with the token: success! and we get all the user data we have so far

up next: continue with register functionality in the client.

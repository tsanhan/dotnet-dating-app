Getting the data from the confirmation modal:

* after we have t a confirm service and a modal lets see how to link all together and get the data out of the confirm dialog.
* go to confirm.service.ts

* test this by editing the profile and navigating away from the page.
* success! 

* but lets use this in another place to feel more easy in using this service.
* lets warn the user when we want to delete a message.
* go to messages.component.ts

* test the delete message dialog confirm modal, try to delete a message.
* success, we see a modal.
* so now we have a modal we can use everywhere in our app.

up next: we'll see what we can do in the message component ( the chat component ), we'll make the page a bit more convenient to use.

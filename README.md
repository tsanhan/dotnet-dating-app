Creating a reusable text input

create a folder called 'forms' and create a complete named 'text-input'.
this will be a reusable component that can be used in multiple places.
what we want to do there is to implement a 'control value accessor'.
we want to access the FormControl object in text-input.

go to text-input.component.ts.

ok so we reduced the code for creating form controls to one line,
up next: using the form builder service to make our code a little cleaner.

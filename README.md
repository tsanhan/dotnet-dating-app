this is a project for building .net core/angular app

brief snapshot:

- build demo dating app: https://datingappcourse.herokuapp.com/
- using registration and login
- see who is online at the same time
- like a user (with dedicated place where we can see who I like and who liked them)
- edit a profile, and persist the changes to DB
- photo upload system - with instant update across the app
- live messaging system
- paganation
- filters

- .net 5 (rebranded .net core to simply .net) as BE
- Angular as FE
- entity freamwork as ORM
- tools: HTML5 Bootstrap CSS TypeScript C#

- so... from 0: no coding expirience, 5:intermediate, to 10: expert, 
this module assume you on 1-4 and targeting levels 4-5.

- I gues you know:
1. OOP: C#/JS classes and object 
2. control flow (if/switch/loops)
3. data structures (array/list)

- I want this module to be practical, project oriented.
- every time we add something to the project we need to learn about it
- there is no pre-build code. no cheating, no snippits, we write from 0! (almost ðŸ˜…)
- bast practices: SOLID.

* we need: 
1. computer
2. vscode (better learn it like this because of cross-platform issues w/ vs)
